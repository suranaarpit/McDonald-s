# McDonald's Virtual Display
 

### About McDonald's - 

McDonald's is an American multinational fast food corporation, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald, in San Bernardino, California, United States. They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand, and later turned the company into a franchise, with the Golden Arches logo being introduced in 1953 at a location in Phoenix, Arizona.

Although McDonald's is best known for its hamburgers, cheeseburgers and french fries, they feature chicken products, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts.

In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because of the unhealthiness of their food, the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit.. As of 2020, McDonald's has the ninth-highest global brand valuation.


### So, here I have built a McDonald's Virtual Display.

* Basically, it's a McDonald's order notification display. Whenever your order is ready, it is displayed on the screen with your order number.
